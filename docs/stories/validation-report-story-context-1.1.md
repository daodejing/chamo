  </metadata>
  <story> (lines 12-26)
    asA, iWant, soThat, tasks
  </story>
  <acceptanceCriteria> (lines 28-35)
  <artifacts> (lines 37-127)
    <docs>, <code>, <dependencies>
  </artifacts>
  <constraints> (lines 129-142)
  <interfaces> (lines 144-180)
  <tests> (lines 182-217)
    standards, locations, ideas
  </tests>

## Partial Items

**None.**

## Recommendations

### 1. Must Fix
**None.** Context is fully compliant and ready for use.

### 2. Should Improve
**None.** All criteria met at high quality standard.

### 3. Consider (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Dependency installation reminder:** Consider adding a setup task to install missing dependencies (react-hook-form, bcrypt, nanoid) before implementation begins.
2. **Test priority ordering:** Consider ordering test ideas by priority (e.g., critical path tests first) rather than by AC number.
3. **Database migration reference:** Could add explicit reference to Supabase migration file location once created.

**Impact:** These are minor process improvements and do not affect readiness for development.

---

## Final Assessment

✅ **APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT**

The story context XML is comprehensive, accurate, and provides complete guidance for implementation. All 10 checklist items pass validation with strong evidence. The context successfully bridges high-level requirements with implementation details, providing:

- Clear acceptance criteria (6 items)
- Actionable constraints (12 rules)
- Reusable interfaces (5 contracts)
- Comprehensive test coverage (17 scenarios)
- Dependency visibility (13 packages)
- Rich documentation references (6 docs + 4 code files)

**Developer readiness:** High. Context can be consumed immediately to begin Story 1.1 implementation.
