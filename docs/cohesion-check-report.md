## 2. Technology & Library Decision Table Validation

### 2.1 Vagueness Check

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - No vague entries detected

All technologies have:
- ✅ Specific versions (e.g., "React 19.2.0", "pnpm 9.x", "Vitest 2.x")
- ✅ Clear purpose and rationale
- ✅ No multi-option entries without decision
- ✅ No placeholders like "appropriate library" or "TBD"

**Examples of Specificity:**
- Frontend: "React Hook Form 7.55.x" (not "a form library")
- Backend: "Supabase Latest" with specific services (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Storage, Auth)
- Encryption: "AES-256-GCM" (not "encryption algorithm")

### 2.2 Technology Completeness

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - All layers covered

| Layer | Technologies Specified | Gap Analysis |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | React 19.2.0, Next.js 15.x | ✅ Complete |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui, Radix UI, TailwindCSS | ✅ Complete |
| **Backend Services** | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Storage, Auth) | ✅ Complete |
| **External APIs** | Groq API, Google OAuth, Google Calendar API | ✅ Complete |
| **Encryption** | Web Crypto API, AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2 | ✅ Complete |
| **Deployment** | Vercel, pnpm 9.x | ✅ Complete |

| **i18n** | Not specified | ⚠️ Minor gap (deferred to implementation) |

**Minor Gap Identified:** i18n library (next-intl vs react-i18next) not selected. **Recommendation:** Decide during Epic 5 implementation, no blocker.

---

## 3. Code vs Design Balance Analysis

### 3.1 Code Block Assessment

**Status:** ⚠️ **WARNING** - Multiple code blocks exceed 10-line guideline

The checklist states: "No code blocks > 10 lines" and "Focus on schemas, patterns, diagrams."

**Code Blocks Found:**
1. `createFamily()` function: ~25 lines (solution-architecture.md:573-601)
2. `joinFamily()` function: ~20 lines (solution-architecture.md:603-627)
3. `encryptMessage()` function: ~20 lines (solution-architecture.md:635-656)
4. `decryptMessage()` function: ~15 lines (solution-architecture.md:658-675)
5. `encryptFile()` function: ~15 lines (solution-architecture.md:677-693)
6. `decryptFile()` function: ~12 lines (solution-architecture.md:695-709)

**Total:** 6 code blocks > 10 lines (107 total lines of implementation code)

### 3.2 Justification Analysis

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **Acceptable Exception**

**Rationale for Exceeding Guideline:**
1. **Security-Critical Code:** E2EE implementation is the most critical architectural decision (ADR-002)
2. **Precision Required:** Crypto implementations cannot be abstracted - any error compromises security
3. **Reference Implementation:** These functions serve as security reference for all implementers
4. **No Over-Specification:** Code shows pattern, not full implementation (error handling, validation omitted)

**Comparison to "Over-Specification" Red Flag:**
- ❌ Complete React components with JSX (would be over-spec)
- ❌ Full API route handlers with middleware (would be over-spec)
- ✅ Crypto primitives (appropriate for security-critical architecture)
- ✅ Database schemas (appropriate level of detail)

**Conclusion:** Exception justified. E2EE code is **reference design**, not implementation.

### 3.3 Design Elements (✅ Appropriate Level)

The architecture appropriately focuses on design-level documentation:
- ✅ Database schemas (CREATE TABLE statements)
- ✅ API contracts (endpoint signatures, request/response types)
- ✅ System diagrams (ASCII art architecture diagrams)
- ✅ Data flow examples (step-by-step flows)
- ✅ Technology stack tables (versions, rationales)

---

## 4. Vagueness & Over-Specification Detection

### 4.1 Vagueness Scan

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - No critical vagueness detected

**Areas Scanned:**
- ✅ Database schema: All tables have explicit columns, types, constraints
- ✅ API routes: All endpoints have HTTP method, path, request/response schemas
- ✅ Component boundaries: Source tree shows exact file structure
- ✅ Security measures: Specific algorithms, key sizes, protocols

**Minor Ambiguities (Acceptable):**
- "shadcn/ui: Latest" - no specific version (acceptable, as shadcn is a component generator)
- "Supabase: Latest" - no specific version (acceptable, managed service auto-updates)

### 4.2 Over-Specification Scan

**Status:** ✅ **PASS** - No over-specification detected (exception: E2EE code justified above)

**What's NOT Over-Specified (Correctly Deferred):**
- ✅ React component implementations (only file names and purposes)
- ✅ Error message copy (deferred to implementation)
- ✅ CSS styles (TailwindCSS classes deferred)
- ✅ Test cases (deferred to tech specs)
- ✅ i18n translations (deferred to implementation)

## 5. Architectural Gaps & Risks

### 5.1 Critical Gaps

**Count:** 0

No critical architectural gaps that would block implementation.

### 5.2 Minor Gaps

**Count:** 3

#### Gap 1: Browser Compatibility Matrix (NFR-7)

**Impact:** Low
**Risk:** Developers may target browsers that don't support Web Crypto API
**Recommendation:** Add browser support matrix to tech spec:
```
Minimum Versions:
- Chrome 90+ (Web Crypto, IndexedDB)
- Firefox 88+ (Web Crypto, IndexedDB)
- Safari 14+ (Web Crypto, IndexedDB)
- Edge 90+ (Chromium-based)
```

#### Gap 2: i18n Library Selection (FR-6.4)

**Impact:** Low
**Risk:** Epic 5 implementation may be delayed by library evaluation
**Recommendation:** Pre-select library in architecture:
- Option A: `next-intl` (Next.js native, better App Router support)
- Option B: `react-i18next` (more mature, larger ecosystem)

**Suggested Decision:** Use `next-intl` for better Next.js 15 integration.

#### Gap 3: Offline Mode Implementation Detail (NFR-4.2)

**Impact:** Low
**Risk:** Unclear how "graceful degradation" is implemented
**Recommendation:** Add to tech spec:
- Service Worker for offline HTML/CSS/JS caching
- IndexedDB for offline message queue
- Display "Offline" indicator in UI
- Sync on reconnection

### 5.3 Deferred to Tech Specs (Acceptable)

The following are correctly deferred to per-epic tech specs:
- Image format detection (FR-3.8)
- Browser notification implementation (FR-4.7)
- Performance benchmarking methodology (NFR-2)
- Error message copy (NFR-3.3)
- Offline sync conflict resolution (NFR-4.2)
- Test coverage strategy
